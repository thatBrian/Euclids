# Euclid's Algorithm
### This project shows how th Euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor(GCD) of two numbers.

## How to compile?
__javac Euclids.java__

## How does it work?
This program takes in 2 arguments
1. Input value one
2. Input value two
*The output of the program will be "Input value one", "Input value two" along with its GCD. The program will also show the number of iterations used to find the GCD.*


## Example
__./java Euclids 20 4__

## Sample Output
The GCD of 20 and 4 is 4
Calculated in 1 iterations
